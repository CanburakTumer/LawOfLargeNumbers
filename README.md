#Law of Large Numbers

Probability Theory says as number of the trials increases, the average outcome will get closer to the expected average output. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers)
This code implements 10k of dice rolls and 10k of coin flips and counts the number of occurings and calculates averages for the 10, 100, 1000 and 10k trials.

## Expected average output for dice rolls : 3.5
## Expected output for coin flips : 1.5 (1 for heads and 2 for tails)

##Sample output
